This blog is written by [Jaime A Castro-Mondragon](https://jaimicore.github.io/) and you will see here a variety of topics, although mainly related to bioinformatics and from time to time a random post.\n\nIf you are wondering about the blog's name '*More Than A Black Screen*', it comes from a conversation with a friend, who told me that working in a terminal (*a black screen*) seems extremely boring. I disagree of course and I think that as a programmer, magic comes from the simplicity of working in a terminal. You can think that working in a terminal is like reading a book without illustrations.\n\n\n::: {.caption}\n\n![Welcome message](mtabs.png){.lightbox}\n\n::: {.justify}\n\nYou can find me also in the following sites, although don't expect much content from me on social media.\n",
