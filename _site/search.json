This blog is written by Jaime A Castro-Mondragon and you will see here a variety of topics, although mainly related to bioinformatics and from time to time a random post.\nIf you are wondering about the blog’s name ‘More Than A Black Screen’, it comes from a conversation with a friend, who told me that working in a terminal (a black screen) seems extremely boring. I disagree of course and I think that as a programmer, magic comes from the simplicity of working in a terminal. You can think that working in a terminal is like reading a book without illustrations.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome message\n\n\n\nYou can find me also in the following sites, although don’t expect much content from me on social media."
