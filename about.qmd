Welcome! This blog is written by [Jaime A Castro-Mondragon](https://jaimicore.github.io/) and you will see here a variety of topics, although mainly related to bioinformatics and from time to time a random post, opinion or thought.

If you are wondering about the blog's name '*More Than A Black Screen*', it comes from a conversation with a friend, who told me that working in a terminal (*a black screen*) seems extremely boring. I disagree of course and I think that as a programmer, magic comes from the simplicity of working in a terminal. You can think that working in a terminal is like reading a book without illustrations.
